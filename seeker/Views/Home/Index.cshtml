                    <p class="lead">Hiring for skills or personality is a hot topic in the HR world. There is no right or wrong answer to this question. When you’re faced with a tough hiring decision between two candidates, you’re going to have to make the best choice for your company. The right choice depends on several different factors.The costs of hiring a new employee is far from cheap and you definitely don’t want to hire the wrong person. Are you going to hire someone with all the degrees, certifications, book smarts, and portfolios you could ever want OR are you going to judge a job candidate on their human attributes like attitude, values, people skills, and personality? It’s a tough situation to be in.</p>

                        Give your teams the power to work with highly skilled independent talent, and you give them the freedom to think more strategically.
                        With Enterprise Suite, we’ll help your teams choose the level of resource, skill, and service they need. And build relationships with independent professionals who can transform how they work. Strategic workforce planning is about making sure you’ve got the right number of people, with the right skills, at the right place at the right time so that they can deliver on the organization’s business goals. Strategic workforce planning allows you to – at least to a certain extent – prepare for demographic and workforce changes.

                        You’re filling critical roles, sourcing niche skills, assembling multidisciplinary teams. You need people who can start creating ROI immediately.
                        This is the home of independent professionals who’ll take the initiative, deliver your project, and share their skills with your team. Interns and freshers can be great for certain kinds of roles that don’t require a lot of expertise or where the business can afford to invest in their learning. Large organisations can, and in fact, benefit from training someone not just skill-wise, but also to root them in the company culture and ways of working early on. However, startups need talent that can be productive as of yesterday and a lack of the right skills for a growing business even for a few months has a far reaching adverse impact.
